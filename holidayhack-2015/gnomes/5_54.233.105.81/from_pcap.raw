Dear Cindy Lou,

 

I am writing to apologize for what I did to you so long ago.  I wronged you
and all the Whos down in Who-ville due to my extreme misunderstanding of
Christmas and a deep-seated hatred.  I should have never lied to you, and I
should have never stolen those gifts on Christmas Eve.  I realize that even
returning them on Christmas morn didn't erase my crimes completely.  I seek
your forgiveness.

 

You see, on Mount Crumpit that fateful Christmas morning, I learned th[4 bytes missing in capture file]at
Christmas doesn't come from a store.  In fact, I discovered that Christmas
means a whole lot more!

 

When I returned their gifts, the Whos embraced me.  They forgave.  I was
stunned, and my heart grew even more.  Why, they even let me carve the roast
beast!  They demonstrated to me that the holiday season is, in part, about
forgiveness and love, and that's the gift that all the Whos gave to me that
morning so long ago.  I honestly tear up thinking about it.

 

I don't expect you to forgive me, Cindy Lou.  But, you have my deepest and
most sincere apologies.

 

And, above all, don't let my horrible actions from so long ago taint you in
any way.  I understand you've grown into an amazing business leader.  You
are a precious and beautiful Who, my dear.  Please use your skills wisely
and to help and support your fellow Who, especially during the holidays.

 

I sincerely wish you a holiday season full of kindness and warmth,

 

--The Grinch
