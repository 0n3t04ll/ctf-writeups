My Burgling Friends, 

 

Our long-running plan is nearly complete, and I'm writing to share the date
when your thieving will commence!  On the morning of December 24, 2015, each
individual burglar on this email list will receive a detailed itinerary of
specific houses and an inventory of items to steal from each house, along
with still photos of where to locate each item.  The message will also
include a specific path optimized for you to hit your assigned houses
quickly and efficiently the night of December 24, 2015 after dark.

 

Further, we've selected the items to steal based on a detailed analysis of
what commands the highest prices on the hot-items open market.  I caution
you - steal only the items included on the list.  DO NOT waste time grabbing
anything else from a house.  There's no sense whatsoever grabbing crumbs too
small for a mouse!

 

As to the details of the plan, remember to wear the Santa suit we provided
you, and bring the extra large bag for all your stolen goods.

 

If any children observe you in their houses that night, remember to tell
them that you are actually "Santy Claus", and that you need to send the
specific items you are taking to your workshop for repair.  Describe it in a
very friendly manner, get the child a drink of water, pat him or her on the
head, and send the little moppet back to bed.  Then, finish the deed, and
get out of there.  It's all quite simple - go to each house, grab the loot,
and return it to the designated drop-off area so we can resell it.  And,
above all, avoid Mount Crumpit! 

 

As we agreed, we'll split the proceeds from our sale 50-50 with each
burglar.

 

Oh, and I've heard that many of you are asking where the name ATNAS comes
from.  Why, it's reverse SANTA, of course.  Instead of bringing presents on
Christmas, we'll be stealing them!

 

Thank you for your partnership in this endeavor. 

 

Signed:

-CLW

President and CEO of ATNAS Corporation
