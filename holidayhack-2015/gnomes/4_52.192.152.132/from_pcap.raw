Dr. O'Malley,

 

In your recent email, you inquired:

 

> When did you first notice your anxiety about the holiday season?

 

Anxiety is hardly the word for it.  It's a deep-seated hatred, Doctor.

 

Before I get into details, please allow me to remind you that we operate
under the strictest doctor-patient confidentiality agreement in the
business.  I have some very powerful lawyers whom I'd hate to invoke in the
event of some leak on your part.  I seek your help because you are the best
psychiatrist in all of Who-ville.

 

To answer your question directly, as a young child (I must have been no more
than two), I experienced a life-changing interaction.  Very late on
Christmas Eve, I was awakened to find a grotesque green Who dressed in a
tattered Santa Claus outfit, standing in my barren living room, attempting
to shove our holiday tree up the chimney.  My senses heightened, I put on my
best little-girl innocent voice and asked him what he was doing.  He
explained that he was "Santy Claus" and needed to send the tree for repair.
I instantly knew it was a lie, but I humored the old thief so I could escape
to the safety of my bed.  That horrifying interaction ruined Christmas for
me that year, and I was terrified of the whole holiday season throughout my
teen years.

 

I later learned that the green Who was known as "the Grinch" and had lost
his mind in the middle of a crime spree to steal Christmas presents.  At the
very moment of his criminal triumph, he had a pitiful change of heart and
started playing all nicey-nice.  What an amateur!  When I became an adult,
my fear of Christmas boiled into true hatred of the whole holiday season.  I
knew that I had to stop Christmas from coming.  But how?

 

I vowed to finish what the Grinch had started, but to do it at a far larger
scale.  Using the latest technology and a distributed channel of burglars,
we'd rob 2 million houses, grabbing their most precious gifts, and selling
them on the open market.  We'll destroy Christmas as two million homes full
of people all cry "BOO-HOO", and we'll turn a handy profit on the whole
deal.

 

Is this "wrong"?  I simply don't care.  I bear the bitter scars of the
Grinch's malfeasance, and singing a little "Fahoo Fores" isn't gonna fix
that!

 

What is your advice, doctor?

 

Signed,

Cindy Lou Who
